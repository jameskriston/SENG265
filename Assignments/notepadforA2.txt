    Respondent* respondent;

 struct Survey_list

    char ** questions;     // arary of strings to hold each question
    char **question_options; // an array of strings to hold each possible answer
    char ** programs
    char **citizenship     
    int total_programs; // int for amount of different possible programs
    int total_citizenships; // int for amount of different possible citizenships                        
    int total_options;     // int for amount of different possible answers (disagree,

};    



so it mostly works, need to fix my agreement_percent in processing.c also probably my average responses function
seems to be a good start though.
